## Normal event handler

```csharp
Alt.Explosion += (player, explosionType, position, explosionFx, targetEntity) => {
    // ...
}
```

## IScript event handler

This is called every time something explodes.

##### Note : ScriptEvents have to be created in a IScript Class! Otherwise it wonÂ´t work!

```csharp
// We create our IScript class
public class MyScriptClass : IScript
{
    // We declare and create our event handler
    [ScriptEvent(ScriptEventType.Explosion)]
        public void Explosion(IPlayer player, ExplosionType explosionType, Position position, uint explosionFx, IEntity targetEntity)
        {
            switch (targetEntity)
            {
                case IPlayer target:
                    Alt.Log(player.Name + " brutally blew up {target.Name}.");
                    return;
                case IVehicle veh:
                    Alt.Log(player.Name + " brutally blew up a " + (VehicleModel)veh.Model + ". The explosion type was " + explosionType + ".");
                    return;
            }

            Alt.Log("Something blew up.");
        }
}
```
