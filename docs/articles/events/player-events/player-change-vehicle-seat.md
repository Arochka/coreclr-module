Alt.OnPlayerChangeVehicleSeat += (vehicle, player, oldSeat, newSeat) => {
    // ...
}
```

## IScript event handler

##### Note : ScriptEvents have to be created in a IScript Class! Otherwise it wonÂ´t work!

```csharp 
    // We create our IScript class
    public class MyScriptClass : IScript
    {
         // We declare and create our event handler
        [ScriptEvent(ScriptEventType.PlayerChangeVehicleSeat)]
        public static void OnPlayerChangeVehicleSeat(IVehicle vehicle, IPlayer player, byte oldSeat, byte newSeat)
        {
            // Simple output.
            player?.SendChatMessage(player.Name + "... you've changed your seat in a " + (VehicleModel)vehicle?.Model + " from " + oldSeat + " to " + newSeat);
        }
    }
```
